# Note Taker

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create an application called Note Taker. This application allows the end user to write and save notes. Further, it uses Express.js and an node engine to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. Equipped with a connected front and back end, this application has been deployed to Heroku for end user interaction.

- This application was designed to make note taking and task tracking easier for users.
- This tool can mitigate the hassle of simple record keeping while promoting sustainability.
- Lesson: Organization and production are correlated.
